# Project 2

## Product Vision

FOR students who have lost or found personal items on campus
WHO does not have a reliable way to report or search,
THE FoundIt is a web-based listing board
THAT lets students report, browse, and claim lost items
UNLIKE posting on random forums or flyers,
OUR app is centralized, searchable, and campus-verified.

## Using the Prototype

You can try the live version of our prototype here:

üîó [FoundIt Live Demo](https://founditapp.netlify.app)

## Included Features:

Hero section explaining the app

Header with buttons to report a lost or found item

Page for submitting a lost item

Page for submitting a found item

Feed showing users posts (lost & found)

Filter to show lost only / found only / all posts

Data is stored and retrieved from a real MongoDB database (nodejs server)

Users can delete posts they created

Users can mark items as resolved

Deployed and fully interactive

## üìÅ Project Structure

Our project is structured as a **mono-repo**

**Frontend**: React app for prototype

**Backend**: Nodejs server and mongodb database

## üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture

### ‚úÖ Key Architectural Qualities

- **Nonfunctional Characteristics**: Performance and responsiveness are critical so users can report and browse posts with minimal delay.
- **Number of Users**: As a campus-wide platform with potential multi-campus use, scalability is a design priority.
- **Product Lifetime**: The system is designed to evolve over time and easy to expand with features like login or media upload in the future.

### üß± Layered Architecture (Based on Figures 4.10 & 4.11)

| Layer | Role in FoundIt |
|-------|------------------|
| **User Interface** | React.js-based browser interface for interacting with the app |
| **UI Management** | Handles forms, user flows (report lost/found), routing |
| **Application Logic** | Controls CRUD for posts, filtering, resolving, deleting |
| **Shared Services** | Express.js REST API endpoints |
| **Database Layer** | MongoDB database via Mongoose ORM |
