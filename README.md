# Project 2

## Product Vision

FOR students who have lost or found personal items on campus
 WHO does not have a reliable way to report or search,
 THE FoundIt is a web-based listing board
 THAT lets students report, browse, and claim lost items
 UNLIKE posting on random forums or flyers,
 OUR app is centralized, searchable, and campus-verified.

## Using the Prototype

You can try the live version of our prototype here:

üîó [FoundIt Live Demo](https://founditapp.netlify.app)

## Included Features:
Hero section explaining the app

Buttons to report a lost or found item

Page for submitting a lost item (form)

Page for submitting a found item (with image upload)

Feed showing dummy posts (lost & found)

Filter to show lost only / found only / all posts

No database or backend is used, all content is static and simulated with dummy data.
