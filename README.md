# Project 2

## Product Vision

FOR students who have lost or found personal items on campus
 WHO does not have a reliable way to report or search,
 THE FoundIt is a web-based listing board
 THAT lets students report, browse, and claim lost items
 UNLIKE posting on random forums or flyers,
 OUR app is centralized, searchable, and campus-verified.
